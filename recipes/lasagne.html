    <ul>
      <li>Beef ragu. Please follow this <a href="ragu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> for our traditional beef ragu recipe.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the bechamel sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>50 g butter</li>
        <li>50 g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>500 ml milk</li>
        <li>A pinch of grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the lasagne:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400-500g lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>50 g grated parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 180c/160c fan/gas mark 4</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the bechemel sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On a low heat, in a small saucepan, melt the butter.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted add the flour and stir continuously until the mixture thickens and forms a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk to the roux, whisking as you go until you get a smooth sauce.</li>
        <li>Continue to whisk the sauce until it has thickened to where it can coat the back of a wooden spoon. Approximately 5 or so minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and season to taste with a little pinch or salt and pepper and grated nutmeg.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Arranging the lasagne</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat the base of a good size baking dish with a spoonful of the previously prepared ragu and then cover with a single layer of lasagne sheets.</li>
        <li>Top the layer of pasta sheets with a generous amount of the bechamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Spoon over a good amount of the ragu and scatter some grated parmesan.</li>
        <li>Repeat the above layers to fill the baking dish and using all of the ragu.</li>
        <li>Add one last lasagne sheet and top with the remaining bechamel sauce and parmesan.</li>
        <li>Place the baking dish into the pre-heated oven and allow to bake for 1 hour until the top has browned and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
